System To Calculete NPS using Email's Service

THIS IS A PROJECT ELABORATED IN #NLW4 BOOTCAMP FROM @ROCKETSEAT
WHITH SOME CHANGES BY AUTHOR @fab1omendes

THIS IS A NPS SYSTEM, THAT CALCULATE THE NOTE THAT CLIENTS GIVE FOR ANY SERVICE.
THE NOTE'S SEARCH IS SEND TO CLIENT'S EMAIL, AND AT THE END IS POSSIBLE TO DO THE NPS CALCULATE.
THIS ISN'T TESTING FOR PRODUCTION, ONLY WAS TESTED USING NODEMAILER(FRAMEWORK), GET AND POST BY INSOMINIA, BUT CAN BE ALTER FOR PRODUCTION.

THE PROJECT USED TYPEORM TO BE POSSIBLE CHANGE THE DATA SYSTEM, ACTUALLY USING SQLITE3.
